Logo Placeholder

This folder should contain:
- logo.png: Company logo image (recommended size: 80x80px or larger, PNG format with transparent background)

The JavaScript application will automatically:
- Load logo.png if it exists
- Show a placeholder "LOGO" box if the file is not found
- Scale the logo to 80x80px in the top-left corner when enabled

To add your logo:
1. Save your logo as "logo.png" in this assets folder
2. Refresh the web application
3. The logo will automatically appear when the "Show Logo" option is enabled

Recommended logo specifications:
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Minimum size: 80x80px (will be scaled down if larger)
- File size: Under 1MB for optimal loading
- Square aspect ratio works best
